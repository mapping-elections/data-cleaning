<span class='change'>King James I chartered two Virginia Companies, headquartered
in different English cities, to establish colonies along the coast of North
America, including islands within 100 miles and, by implication, extending
inland 100 miles: the Virginia Company of London, assigned coast between 34
degrees and 41 degrees north latitude; and the Virginia Company of Plymouth,
assigned coast between 38 degrees and 45 degrees north latitude, including
present New York. Colonies of the two companies were to be at least 100 miles
apart, even where the grants overlapped.</span>

erupted between the English and the Dutch in 1652. This agreement divided Long
Island by a line extending due south from Oyster Bay and, on the mainland,
prescribed a line 20 miles long running due north from Greenwich Bay, but
specified no other limits. Conflict over uncertain colonial limits continued

intersection of the Delaware River at the parallel of 41 degrees, 40 minutes

Dutch, swiftly took control of the rest of New Netherland, and renamed the
province New York. Territory included present New Jersey, New York, and
Vermont. In October 1664, the Duke of York's forces captured Fort Casimir (now
New Castle, Del.), thereby completing their conquest of New Netherland and
bringing the west side of Delaware Bay (also claimed by Maryland), including
present Delaware and Pennsylvania, under the de facto control of the Duke and
New York. The conquest was confirmed in 1667 by the Peace of Breda.</span>

the Duke of York and the western limit of Massachusetts, as specified in its
1629 charter, by proposing a boundary line running 20 miles east of the Hudson

not prevent a long, serious dispute between the two colonies.</span>
